# Exchange Rate App

### Created by Sarah Gilbert

## Description

##### This webpage is a currency exchange application that was created to further my knowledge and skills with the use of API's. I built the application with the use of an API that I pulled from www.exchangerate-api.com, where after signing up, I was given access to my own personal API key. If working correctly, the application should allow the user to covert U.S. currency into 5 other types of currencies, which are the European Euro, the Great British Pound, the Thai Baht, the South African Rand, and Japanese Yen. If the API call does not go through, the user should recieve a notification that states why the call is not going through.
